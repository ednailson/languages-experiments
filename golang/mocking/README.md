## gomock vs mockery

| *           | docker generated | flexible mocks | stars on github |
|-------------|:----------------:|---------------:|-----------------|
| **gomock**  |       true       |           true | 7.1k            |
| **mockery** |       true       |           true | 3.4k            |


Both libraries have good features. The only downside from gomock is that the docker support is not official.
However, both libs do a great job, so I think we can choose anyone.
