## gomock vs mockery

| *           | docker generated | flexible mocks | stars on github |
|-------------|:----------------:|---------------:|-----------------|
| **gomock**  |       true       |           true | 7.1k            |
| **mockery** |       true       |           true | 3.4k            |


Both libraries have good features. The only downside from `gomock` is that the docker support is not official.
However, I think `gomock` is more readable but both libs do a great job. I think we can choose anyone.
